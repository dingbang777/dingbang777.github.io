Hi, I am a third-year undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and [Prof. Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) at MVIG-RHOS. I also intern at Shanghai AI Laboratory, advised by [Prof. Bo Dai](https://daibo.info/) and [Yanhong Zeng](https://zengyh1900.github.io/). Previously, I was a research intern at IRMV, advised by [Prof. Hesheng Wang](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng).

My research interests mainly lies in **Generative Models** and **Embodied AI**. I have background in image generation, 3D human-object interaction and robotic navigation. Now I am pretty interested in **human motion modeling**, **its interaction with object and scene** and its application in **robotics**.

**I am actively looking for internship opportunity during the summer of 2025!**

Research Experience
======
**Shanghai AI Laboratory - IDC group & Embodied AI Center**   
* Research Intern – Supervisor: Prof. Bo Dai & Yanhong Zeng
* Research topic: Image generation and editing.
* Layered Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models. Preparing for ICCV2025.

**Shanghai Jiao Tong University - MVIG-RHOS**   
* Undergraduate Research Intern – Supervisor: Prof. Yong-Lu Li & Prof. Cewu Lu
* Research topic: 3D human-object-interaction reconstruction
* Designed a novel 3D HOI optimizer based on 3D Gaussian Splatting and contact optimization to reconstruct the spatial interactions between humans and objects from single images.
* Utilized SOTA 3D reconstruction tools to develop a 3D HOI annotation and reconstruction pipeline, and build a new and scalable in-the-wild 3D HOI dataset Open3DHOI consisting of 2.5k+ images with rich 2D and 3D annotations.

**Shanghai Jiao Tong University - IRMV**   
* Undergraduate Research Intern – Supervisor: Prof. Hengsheng Wang
* Research topic: Robotic navigation
* Developed an efficient memory-enhanced navigation framework called MENEO, which builds spatial cognition of historically explored areas by memorizing the self-movements of mobile robots, thereby eliminating the need to store and process redundant raw scene features as previous methods did.
